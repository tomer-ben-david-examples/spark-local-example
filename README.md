# Study spark locally
So you wish to study spark, great! now lets start a spark cluster, just download a 4GB image from cloudera and start a vm every time you need to run a silly example.  Or use your ready made vm's.  This sounds silly.  Why not have a template for running spark examples locally and practice with them.  This is exactly what this sample project is about.

# Study spark inside intellij
The examples can be run smoothly in intellij.

# Examples and csv file analysis locally
